## **Part I: The Unraveling of the Post-War Order – Debt, Demographics, and De-dollarization**

The global economic and political order that has prevailed since the end of the Second World War is under unprecedented strain. A confluence of structural forces—unsustainable debt trajectories in the West, shifting demographic profiles, and a direct challenge to the monetary system that has underwritten global trade for half a century—is creating a "polycrisis" or "metacrisis".1 This is not a cyclical downturn but a paradigm shift, forcing a fundamental re-evaluation of the assumptions that have guided policymakers, investors, and strategists for decades. This section deconstructs the foundational pillars of the current global system and examines the structural stresses that threaten their stability, analyzing the core arguments presented by leading thinkers regarding the terminal nature of U.S. debt dynamics and the consequential shifts in the global monetary order.

### **The Inescapable Math: The U.S. Fiscal Predicament**

The foundation of the current global instability rests upon a simple, yet profound, reality: the fiscal trajectory of the United States, the issuer of the world's primary reserve currency, is unsustainable. This is not a matter of political ideology but of arithmetic. The structural mismatch between the growth of mandatory government spending, the accelerating cost of servicing the national debt, and the capacity of the tax base to keep pace has created a situation that will compel radical policy choices, regardless of which political party holds power.1

Financial analyst Luke Gromen has articulated this predicament in stark terms, asserting that the U.S. federal government's finances have reached a critical tipping point. He claims that mandatory outlays, primarily entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, consume between 70% and 75% of annual tax receipts. Compounding this, another 25% of receipts are allocated to paying net interest on the federal debt. This places the U.S. in a position where these two non-discretionary spending categories are approaching, or in some years exceeding, 100% of total government revenue. Furthermore, these costs are growing at a rate that significantly outpaces the growth of tax receipts, creating a compounding problem.1

A review of official data validates this alarming assessment. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and U.S. Treasury data for fiscal year 2023, total federal outlays were $6.13 trillion against revenues of $4.44 trillion. Within this, mandatory spending programs accounted for $3.8 trillion, or 85.6% of all revenues. Net interest payments on the debt amounted to $659 billion, or another 14.8% of revenues. Combined, these two categories of spending totaled $4.459 trillion, equivalent to **100.4% of total federal revenues** for that year.2 Gromen's claim is therefore factually correct. The trend is also worsening. Driven by higher prevailing interest rates, net interest costs are the fastest-growing component of the federal budget and are on track to exceed spending on national defense in 2024 for the first time in modern history.5

This fiscal reality reveals a profound structural transformation of the U.S. government. With mandatory spending and interest consuming all tax revenue, the entirety of the discretionary budget—which funds the military, infrastructure, scientific research, education, and all other functions of government—is now financed through the issuance of new debt. This dynamic establishes a dangerous feedback loop: as demographics drive mandatory spending higher and rising debt pushes interest costs up, the deficit required to fund the same level of discretionary spending must also expand, leading to even more debt and even higher interest payments in the future. This mathematical certainty severely curtails the United States' capacity to respond to future crises, be they geopolitical, environmental, or medical, using conventional fiscal measures. It makes unconventional policies, such as the direct monetization of debt, not merely an option but a structural necessity.

Renowned economist Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University corroborates this grim outlook, describing the U.S. fiscal position as "unsustainable".1 His research on historical financial crises suggests that such situations, where high debt levels meet political polarization and inflexibility, are typically resolved by an external shock that forces a resolution. For a sovereign currency issuer like the United States, which can print its own money, an outright default is unlikely. Instead, Rogoff identifies high inflation as the most probable "release valve"—a form of soft default that erodes the real value of the outstanding debt and brings the debt-to-GDP ratio back to a more manageable level.1

This leads to a point of consensus among otherwise divergent thinkers like Gromen and global strategist Michael Every: the United States will be forced to "print the interest".1 The political choices of implementing deep, structural cuts to popular entitlement programs or enacting massive, broad-based tax increases are considered untenable in the current polarized environment. Therefore, the only politically palatable path forward is for the U.S. Treasury to continue issuing debt to cover its shortfalls, with the Federal Reserve ultimately being compelled to purchase that debt to prevent a spike in interest rates that would crash the economy and make the fiscal situation even more dire. This inevitable conclusion—that debt will be monetized—sets the stage for the strategic and geopolitical debates that will define the coming era.

### **The Petrodollar's Twilight?**

For the past fifty years, the U.S. dollar's status as the world's undisputed reserve currency has been underpinned not just by the size and dynamism of the American economy, but by a specific geopolitical arrangement known as the petrodollar system. This system, forged in a moment of crisis for the dollar, created a structural, inelastic global demand for U.S. financial assets. Today, however, shifting geopolitical alliances and the overt weaponization of the dollar are eroding the foundations of this system, prompting a strategic reassessment by major world powers and signaling a potential end to an era of uncontested American financial hegemony.

The genesis of the petrodollar system lies in the "Nixon Shock" of August 15, 1971\. On that day, President Richard Nixon unilaterally suspended the direct convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system that had governed international finance since 1944\.1 Under Bretton Woods, the dollar was pegged to gold at $35 per ounce, and other major currencies were pegged to the dollar. By the late 1960s, however, massive U.S. spending on the Vietnam War and domestic "Great Society" programs led to a surge in dollars held abroad, far exceeding the U.S. gold reserves available to back them. As countries like France and the United Kingdom began demanding gold for their dollar holdings, the U.S. faced a classic bank run.10 Nixon's decision to close the gold window severed the dollar's last tie to a physical asset, turning it into a pure fiat currency and triggering a crisis of confidence. The dollar's value plummeted against other currencies, and the U.S. experienced a severe bout of inflation.1

To solve this crisis, the Nixon administration, led by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Treasury Secretary William Simon, engineered a brilliant strategic pivot. In a series of negotiations during 1973 and 1974, the U.S. forged a landmark agreement with Saudi Arabia, the dominant power in OPEC. The deal was straightforward: the U.S. would provide the Kingdom with advanced weaponry and a comprehensive security guarantee. In return, Saudi Arabia would agree to price all of its oil sales exclusively in U.S. dollars and, crucially, to invest its surplus oil revenues—its "petrodollars"—into U.S. Treasury debt securities. By 1975, all of OPEC had agreed to similar terms.13

This arrangement created a powerful, self-reinforcing loop. Since every country needs to import energy, every country now needed to acquire U.S. dollars to buy oil. This established a permanent, global demand for the dollar that was independent of the health of the U.S. economy. Furthermore, the recycling of petrodollars back into U.S. government bonds created a captive and deep market for American debt, allowing the U.S. to finance its growing trade and budget deficits at a lower cost than would otherwise have been possible. As Luke Gromen frames it, the system made "U.S. Treasury bonds as good as gold for oil".1 The dollar was no longer backed by gold; it was now backed by a claim on the world's most essential commodity.

This system is now unraveling. Gromen argues the initial cracks appeared around 2005 with the onset of "peak cheap oil" and the rise of China as a major energy importer, which began to erode the real value of Treasuries in oil terms.1 While the U.S. shale revolution provided a temporary reprieve by boosting domestic energy production, the fundamental drivers of decay have accelerated. A pivotal moment, identified by both Alex Gladstein and Luke Gromen, was the 2022 decision by G7 nations to freeze Russia's foreign currency reserves following the invasion of Ukraine.1 This action transformed the perception of U.S. Treasury bonds from a risk-free asset into a potential political weapon. For sovereign nations, particularly those not squarely in the Western camp like China and Saudi Arabia, holding dollar reserves became a significant strategic vulnerability. The very tools that enforce dollar dominance—sanctions, reserve seizures, and control over payment systems like SWIFT—have become the primary catalysts for de-dollarization. The "exorbitant privilege" of issuing the reserve currency has morphed into an "exorbitant threat" for its users, compelling them to seek alternatives. This has led to a verifiable surge in gold purchases by central banks and a concerted effort, as noted by Kenneth Rogoff, by countries like China to build alternative financial "rails" to bypass the U.S.-controlled system.1 The more the U.S. leverages its financial power, the more rapidly the rest of the world builds defenses against it, creating a feedback loop that is actively dismantling the petrodollar architecture.

### **The Rise of a Multipolar Monetary System**

The erosion of the petrodollar system does not imply an imminent collapse of the U.S. dollar, but it does signal an inexorable shift away from a unipolar, dollar-centric world toward a more fragmented and contested monetary landscape. The key point of contention among strategic thinkers is not *if* this shift is happening, but what the successor system will look like. The debate forces a first-principles re-evaluation of the nature of money itself, pitting traditional stores of value against new technological protocols and political power blocs.

One vision, articulated most forcefully by Luke Gromen, posits a return to a system anchored in physical reality. He argues the world is moving toward a new monetary standard where energy, the ultimate real good, is priced in terms of gold, a neutral, hard asset that cannot be printed by any government. In this framework, a fixed unit of energy (e.g., a barrel of oil) would be valued at a certain weight of gold. This gold price for energy would then float against all fiat currencies, creating a powerful incentive for global energy efficiency and rational economic behavior. A country that wasted energy would see its currency devalue against the energy-gold standard. This is not a return to old-school mercantilism, which focused on hoarding a static pile of gold, but a dynamic new system where money's value is directly tied to the foundational resource of the modern economy.1

Michael Every offers a more skeptical and politically grounded vision. He foresees a messier transition to a "mercantilist world" composed of competing geopolitical and economic blocs. In this scenario, the dollar does not disappear but transforms. It ceases to be a universal reserve asset and becomes the currency of a U.S.-led bloc, encompassing key allies like the Anglosphere nations, Japan, and South Korea. Its value would be backed not by gold or a promise of convertibility, but by the combined productive capacity and overwhelming military might of this alliance. Trade would become increasingly "ring-fenced" within these blocs, with "bamboo curtains and iron curtains" re-emerging to separate competing economic spheres.1 The mechanics of this transition are already visible at the margins. Every points to the rise of "bilateral barter priced in dollars, but not cleared in dollars".1 This is how countries in the BRICS+ orbit are beginning to trade, using the dollar as a unit of account to value goods but settling the final transaction in their own local currencies, thus bypassing the U.S. financial system.

Kenneth Rogoff presents a third perspective, one of slow erosion rather than a dramatic reset. He acknowledges that China and other nations are diversifying into gold and building alternative payment systems, but he emphasizes the immense inertia of the current system and what he sees as the unique "dynamism and creativity" of the U.S. economy, which challengers lack. In his view, the dollar's privileged position will decline, but it will be a long, drawn-out process over decades, not a sudden event.1

The breakdown of the singular dollar standard is forcing a global debate over the fundamental question: "What is money?" The current system defines money as a fiat currency—a liability of the state that is a claim on the future productivity and stability of its issuer. The fiscal unsustainability and political weaponization of the dollar are undermining global confidence in that future claim. This has opened the door to competing definitions. Gromen's proposal defines money as a direct claim on present energy, priced in gold. Every's vision redefines money as a claim on the productive and military power within a specific geopolitical sphere. Alex Gladstein introduces a fourth paradigm: money as a decentralized, non-state protocol like Bitcoin, which is a claim on nothing but the mathematical integrity of its own network.1 The future of the global economy, the distribution of wealth, and the nature of international relations will be determined by which of these definitions of money ultimately prevails. This is no longer an academic debate; it is the central strategic question of the emerging world order.

## **Part II: Geopolitical Realignment and the New Mercantilism**

The structural decay of the post-war financial order is compelling a strategic realignment among major global powers. As the old system unravels, nations are abandoning the cooperative assumptions of globalization in favor of more competitive, state-centric strategies. This section transitions from diagnosing the systemic problems to analyzing the national responses, focusing on the intensifying rivalry between the United States and China and the profound internal policy shifts required to compete in a new, more confrontational era of neo-mercantilism.

### **The Sino-American Standoff: Economic Power vs. Geopolitical Reality**

The central axis of the new geopolitical era is the competition between the United States and China. A clear-eyed assessment of this rivalry requires moving beyond simplistic narratives of either China's inevitable rise or its imminent collapse. China presents a unique challenge as a peer competitor possessing immense industrial scale, yet it is also beset by deep-seated structural weaknesses in its economy and demographics. Its primary strength—a colossal, export-oriented manufacturing base—is proving to be a brittle foundation in a world that is rapidly de-globalizing.

Kenneth Rogoff offers a deeply bearish assessment of China's prospects. He argues that the country is mired in a "deep crisis" stemming from decades of debt-fueled overinvestment in infrastructure and a collapsing property market, the seeds of which were sown in the massive stimulus following the 2008 financial crisis.1 He contends that under President Xi Jinping, technocratic competence has been supplanted by political loyalty, and economic growth has slowed dramatically. Rogoff's forecast is stark: he projects that China's economy will gain only about 1% per year on the U.S. in nominal GDP terms, and that it will take a "long, long time" for it to surpass the U.S. economy in size, if it ever does.1

This view contrasts with that of strategists like Michael Every and Luke Gromen, who see China primarily through the lens of its physical economy. They identify China as a "far larger producer of almost everything physical," a reality that poses a direct challenge to the U.S. in a new mercantilist world where productive capacity is the ultimate measure of power.1 They view China's strategic actions—hoarding commodities, accumulating gold, and building non-dollar trade settlement systems—as deliberate and potent moves to counter American financial dominance.1

The dichotomy between these views is reflected in economic data. A fact-check of GDP figures reveals two different stories. Measured in nominal U.S. dollars, the American economy remains significantly larger, at approximately $27.4 trillion in 2023 compared to China's $17.8 trillion.16 This supports Rogoff's point that for purchasing internationally traded goods, from advanced weaponry to oil, nominal dollar GDP is the relevant metric. However, when measured by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which accounts for differences in local prices, China's economy is substantially larger, at an estimated $34.6 trillion.16 This PPP advantage is highly relevant for assessing a nation's ability to mobilize domestic resources for a strategic purpose, such as paying soldiers or building naval vessels in local shipyards, lending credence to the "peer competitor" view. The most accurate assessment is that both metrics are valid and reveal different dimensions of national power. Recent downward revisions to China's growth forecasts from the IMF and major investment banks, citing the persistent property crisis and weak consumer demand, further support Rogoff's underlying pessimism about its long-term trajectory.18

This analysis reveals that China's economic strength is fundamentally brittle. Its model, which relies on suppressed domestic consumption, extremely high savings rates, and massive state-directed investment in export-oriented production, is optimized for a globalized world that is rapidly disappearing.1 As Michael Every argues, this model requires China to maintain a "winning" position in global trade, running huge surpluses with importers of last resort like the United States and Europe.1 The emerging era of tariffs, onshoring, and bloc-based trade is a direct assault on this economic structure. This places the Chinese Communist Party in a strategic bind. It cannot easily pivot to a consumption-led growth model without implementing a robust social safety net and undertaking major political reforms that would fundamentally challenge its top-down control.1 The likely strategic response, therefore, is for China to double down on its existing model: attempting to export its way out of its domestic problems by flooding global markets with subsidized goods like electric vehicles and solar panels. This will only intensify trade conflicts and accelerate the formation of the protectionist economic blocs that Every describes, further validating the thesis of a fragmented and confrontational world.

### **The Return of the State: Industrial Policy and "Weird" Economics**

The dual pressures of fiscal crisis and renewed geopolitical competition are forcing a paradigm shift in Western economic thought, particularly in the United States. The laissez-faire, market-fundamentalist consensus that has dominated for four decades is being abandoned in favor of a more state-directed, neo-mercantilist model. This entails the adoption of "weird" and historically unorthodox policies designed to rebuild national productive capacity and subordinate financial interests to strategic imperatives.

Michael Every provides the most comprehensive framework for this new political economy. He argues for a suite of policies that are a direct rejection of the neoliberal consensus. First among these is the strategic use of tariffs. In this new paradigm, tariffs are not simply a tool for protecting inefficient industries but a geopolitical weapon used to re-industrialize the domestic economy, reshore critical supply chains, and selectively reward strategic allies while punishing adversaries.1 This is an explicit return to the Hamiltonian model of a developmental state that fostered early American industry.1 Second, Every contends that the inevitable monetization of government debt—the "printing of money"—must be channeled exclusively into the supply side of the economy. This means funding factories, modernizing infrastructure, advancing education, and investing in research and development, rather than stimulating consumption through direct payments to individuals. It is, in effect, Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) repurposed for national security.1 Third, this framework necessitates the abandonment of a single, market-driven interest rate. Instead, the state must actively direct capital through a system of differentiated rates: providing cheap, subsidized credit for national priorities like green technology and defense manufacturing, while imposing high interest rates on unproductive speculation in assets like real estate or commodities. This requires the re-imposition of capital controls and significant financial re-regulation.1

Luke Gromen views this shift through a political lens, describing it as a "political revolution".1 He argues that this new model represents a 180-degree reversal of the post-1980s order, which subjugated the interests of the American working class and industrial base to the primacy of the bond market and Wall Street. The new model, in his view, explicitly prioritizes domestic labor and production over the value of financial assets.1

These proposed policies, while "alien" to the consensus of the past forty years, are not without historical precedent. Every's claim that David Ricardo's foundational theory of comparative advantage was contingent on the assumption of immobile capital is factually correct and a cornerstone of heterodox critiques of globalization.1 Ricardo's 19th-century model did not envision a world where capital could instantly move to the lowest-wage location, a reality that undermines the theory's promise of mutual benefit from trade. Policies such as protective tariffs and state-directed credit were standard practice in the United States and other successful developmental states for much of their history.

The embrace of these policies signifies more than a mere adjustment; it represents the weaponization of economic theory itself. The debate is no longer about which policies are most efficient within the existing neoclassical framework, but rather a battle between competing economic paradigms. The dominant neoliberal model, with its focus on global efficiency and free capital flows, structurally benefits financial capital and transnational corporations. The emerging neo-mercantilist model, as articulated by Every, prioritizes national productive capacity, domestic labor, and supply chain security, structurally benefiting the nation-state and its industrial base. To adopt the latter is to declare economic war on the former. It is a choice to intentionally disrupt global supply chains, invalidate the business models of many multinational firms, and challenge the power of global finance. Consequently, international relations will increasingly be defined by which economic "ism" a country adopts. Alliances will form between nations with compatible models, while conflict will intensify between those with incompatible ones. Economic policy is no longer a domain separate from foreign policy; it has become the primary battlefield of great power competition.

### **Europe at a Strategic Crossroads**

Europe finds itself in a uniquely perilous position, caught between a revanchist Russia on its eastern flank, an increasingly demanding American ally, and its own deep-seated institutional contradictions. The war in Ukraine has exposed the European Union's fundamental unpreparedness for an era of hard power politics, forcing an existential debate about its future. Europe must now achieve "strategic autonomy," but it is fiscally constrained by its own rules, politically fragmented, and its populace is deeply divided on the path forward.

Michael Every vividly illustrates this paralysis with the example of Poland. As a frontline state, Poland is aggressively re-arming and spending heavily on defense to counter the Russian threat. Yet, for this act of collective security, it faces the prospect of being fined by Brussels for violating the EU's budget deficit rules.1 This single anecdote encapsulates the core dysfunction of the European project: its institutional architecture is fundamentally misaligned with the geopolitical realities it now confronts.

The scale of the challenge is immense. Citing his own institution's research as well as a landmark report by former ECB President Mario Draghi, Every estimates that Europe must spend an additional 4% to 6% of its GDP *annually for decades* on defense, energy security, and technological sovereignty to close the gap with other major powers. Given the fiscal constraints on member states, this colossal sum can only be financed by having the European Central Bank (ECB) effectively "print" the money, a politically explosive proposition that would require a radical overhaul of the EU's treaties and the ECB's mandate.1

Luke Gromen argues that this top-down strategic dilemma is compounded by a profound disconnect between European leaders and their citizens. He contends that many ordinary Europeans do not share their leaders' appetite for a confrontation with Russia and resent policies that have led to de-industrialization and higher energy costs from swapping cheap Russian pipeline gas for expensive American liquefied natural gas (LNG). From this perspective, the rise of populist and "far-right" parties is not an aberration but a common-sense reaction from a populace that feels its economic well-being is being sacrificed for a geopolitical agenda it does not support.1

The continent faces a stark and inescapable choice. The first path, advocated by figures like Draghi and analyzed by Every, is for Europe to undertake a massive, state-led, and centrally financed re-industrialization and militarization, effectively transforming the Eurozone into a fiscal and military union—a true "United States of Europe." The second path, reflecting Gromen's analysis of popular sentiment, would involve Europe making a separate peace with Russia, rebuilding its energy relationship, and pursuing a more independent foreign policy, a move that would likely fracture NATO and distance the continent from the United States. The third and default path is to continue to dither, unable to commit to either strategy, and thereby condemn the continent to what Draghi terms a "slow agony," gradually losing relevance and becoming a wealthy but powerless museum—a geopolitical pawn and a cheap tourist destination for more decisive global powers.1

This crisis reveals that the Euro and the entire EU institutional framework are products of a specific historical moment—a "fair-weather" design for a post-historical world of perpetual peace, free trade, and American security guarantees. The EU's fiscal rules, such as the Stability and Growth Pact, were created to enforce discipline in a peacetime economy; they are structurally incapable of accommodating the vast expenditures required for war and strategic competition. The ECB's mandate is focused on price stability, not on financing a war economy. Unlike the United States, with its single federal government and central bank, Europe's fragmented political authority provides no clear mechanism to suspend these rules and direct MMT-style financing toward strategic priorities. The war in Ukraine is therefore not just a test of NATO's military resolve but an existential test of the European Union and its currency. Europe must either evolve into a genuine super-state capable of acting decisively in a dangerous world, or it will risk fracturing as its member states are forced to prioritize their individual national security, potentially leading to the unraveling of the entire European project.

## **Part III: Foundational Critiques and Alternative Paradigms**

The unfolding polycrisis is prompting critiques that go beyond policy and strategy to question the fundamental moral and physical underpinnings of the entire global system. This section moves to a higher level of abstraction to examine these foundational arguments, exploring the concept of the modern financial architecture as a form of colonial extraction, the inherent conflict between infinite financial claims and a finite physical world, and the radical alternative paradigm offered by non-state monetary systems like Bitcoin.

### **Monetary Colonialism: A Critique of the Global Financial Architecture**

A powerful critique, articulated by human rights advocate Alex Gladstein, posits that the international financial system established after World War II is not a neutral framework for global development but a sophisticated system of "monetary colonialism." This system, centered on the U.S. dollar and managed by institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, perpetuates the economic exploitation of the Global South for the material benefit of the Global North.1

Gladstein's core argument is that the West sustains its high standard of living by systematically suppressing wages in the periphery and extracting cheap labor and raw materials. In this modern arrangement, debt has replaced the warship as the primary instrument of control. Developing nations are encouraged or coerced into taking on loans denominated in U.S. dollars, which they cannot print. This creates a permanent dependency, as these nations must constantly export real goods and resources to earn the dollars needed to service their debt.1 This dynamic is exacerbated by the policy decisions of the U.S. Federal Reserve. When the Fed raises interest rates to combat domestic inflation, as it did in the early 1980s and again recently, it has a devastating impact on indebted nations in the Global South. The cost of servicing their dollar-denominated debt skyrockets, often triggering a financial crisis. At this point, the IMF intervenes, offering bailout loans conditioned on the implementation of "structural adjustment" programs. These programs typically mandate austerity (slashing public services), privatization of state assets, and currency devaluation, policies that inflict immense hardship on the local population but ensure that Western creditors are repaid.1

This thesis is substantiated by empirical research. Gladstein asserts that the net flow of resources and capital permanently reversed course in the early 1980s, shifting from a North-to-South flow to a South-to-North drain.1 Academic studies, notably by economist Jason Hickel and his colleagues, have quantified this phenomenon. Their research on "unequal exchange" demonstrates that because wages and resource prices are systematically suppressed in the South, these countries must export a far greater volume of real goods and labor to pay for a single unit of imports from the North. Hickel's team calculated that in 2015 alone, the Global North appropriated resources and labor from the South worth $10.8 trillion (valued at Northern prices). The total value of this drain from 1990 to 2015 was estimated at a staggering $242 trillion.22

The CFA Franc zone in West and Central Africa serves as a stark case study of this monetary colonialism.1 Fourteen African nations use a currency, the CFA Franc, that is pegged to the Euro and historically guaranteed by the French Treasury. In exchange for this "stability," these nations were required to deposit 50% of their foreign currency reserves with France, grant preferential economic access to French companies, and surrender their monetary sovereignty. They cannot devalue their currency to boost exports or use independent monetary policy to finance their own development. The result, as Gladstein argues and historical analysis confirms, has been decades of economic stagnation and continued dependency on their former colonial ruler.26

This analysis reveals the moral and practical bankruptcy of the conventional post-war "development" model. The system of loans and aid administered by institutions like the IMF and World Bank has often failed to produce sovereign prosperity, instead creating inescapable debt traps and perpetuating dependency. The "failed states" and geopolitical instability across much of the Global South are not historical accidents but, in many cases, a direct outcome of this financial architecture. The deep-seated anger and resentment bred by this system have made these nations willing partners in anti-Western political coalitions like the expanded BRICS, creating the very geopolitical challenges that now preoccupy Western strategists. In a profound instance of geopolitical blowback, the system of exploitation has fueled the forces that now threaten to overturn it.

### **The Physical Limits to Financialization**

Underpinning the entire global polycrisis is a fundamental and often-overlooked reality: all financial assets are ultimately claims on real-world energy and commodities. The modern financial system, with its capacity to create vast sums of money and credit seemingly "ex nihilo" (out of nothing), has become dangerously detached from this physical foundation. This has created a colossal "financial overhang" of claims that far exceeds the productive capacity of the real economy, a structural imbalance that must, inevitably, be reconciled through a painful and disruptive process.

The phrase "you can't print commodities," used by Michael Every, serves as the unifying concept for this critical insight.1 It captures the essential difference between the infinite, abstract world of finance and the finite, physical world of resources. Luke Gromen is the most explicit proponent of this energy-based view of economics. He argues that the beginning of the end for the original petrodollar system was not a political decision but a geological one: "peak cheap oil" around 2005\. In his framework, the true value of a U.S. Treasury bond is not its nominal dollar price, but the number of barrels of oil it can command. As cheap energy became scarcer, the real value of these financial claims began to decline.1 The U.S. shale boom, fueled by a combination of technological innovation and zero-interest-rate policy, provided a temporary reprieve, allowing the U.S. to continue, in his words, "printing money for oil." With shale production now having plateaued, that era of financially-subsidized energy is over.1

This accumulation of financial claims in excess of the real economy's capacity to service them is what podcast host Nate Hagens terms the "financial overhang," calling it the "Achilles' heel" and "Gordian knot" of modern civilization.1 Kenneth Rogoff's extensive research on the history of financial crises provides the empirical evidence for what happens when this overhang collapses. His work demonstrates that major financial crises, like those in Japan in the 1990s and the U.S. in 2008, do not result in temporary recessions from which the economy quickly recovers. Instead, they inflict deep and permanent losses on a country's potential GDP.1 For example, studies on the 2008 crisis estimate a permanent loss to U.S. GDP of between 2% and 7% relative to its pre-crisis trend.31 This historical pattern of permanent economic damage is the precedent for what a future, larger-scale deleveraging—a "Great Simplification"—might entail.

This leads to a crucial realization about the function of inflation. Inflation is not merely a monetary phenomenon of "too much money chasing too few goods." It is the primary social and political mechanism through which the abstract world of finance is forcibly reconciled with the constraints of the physical world. It is the process by which the financial overhang is destroyed. When a supply shock occurs—such as an energy crisis—or when demand is artificially boosted through massive stimulus, the imbalance between the volume of financial claims and the availability of real goods and services manifests as a rise in the general price level. This inflation acts as a de facto default on all existing financial assets. A 10% inflation rate effectively confiscates 10% of the real value of all cash and fixed-income bonds. The coming era will therefore be defined by a political battle over who will bear the costs of this inflationary reconciliation. Will the losses be imposed on bondholders and savers through inflation, on the general populace through taxation and austerity, or on foreign nations through the mechanisms of monetary colonialism? The choices made in this struggle will determine the social cohesion of nations and the shape of the new geopolitical order. The "Leninist phase" that Michael Every describes is, in essence, the violent political struggle over the allocation of these inevitable inflationary losses.1

### **Bitcoin: Lifeboat or Speculative Delusion?**

Amid the decay of the state-controlled, debt-based monetary system, a radical alternative has emerged: Bitcoin. As a decentralized, non-state digital currency, Bitcoin represents a fundamental challenge to the existing financial order. Its potential as a tool for individual sovereignty and a neutral global settlement asset is championed by advocates like Alex Gladstein. However, this potential is weighed against significant critiques regarding its volatility, energy consumption, and the direct threat it poses to the power of the nation-state.

Gladstein's advocacy for Bitcoin is rooted not in investment speculation but in its utility for human rights. He recounts how Bitcoin has served as a lifeline for activists and dissidents operating under authoritarian regimes. Because it is permissionless, censorship-resistant, and seizure-resistant, it allows individuals who have been de-banked or cut off from the traditional financial system to receive funding and transact. He cites examples from WikiLeaks, which turned to Bitcoin after being cut off by payment processors, to activists in Ukraine and women in Afghanistan who used it to achieve financial autonomy.1 From this perspective, Bitcoin is the ultimate tool for achieving a "separation of money and state." It functions as both "digital cash" for transactions and "digital gold" for savings, protecting individuals from the dual threats of government-induced currency devaluation and politically motivated de-platforming.1 Gladstein envisions a future where a neutral, apolitical money like Bitcoin could dismantle the "monetary colonialism" of the dollar system and create a world of "equal monetary opportunity," free from the Cantillon effect (where those closest to the money printer benefit most) and exploitative exchange rates.1

The most prominent critique of Bitcoin is its high energy consumption. Gladstein confronts this directly, arguing that this energy use is a feature, not a bug. The "proof-of-work" algorithm, which requires massive computational effort, is what secures the network and makes it incorruptible. Without this tie to a real-world cost, Bitcoin would be just another easily manipulated digital token.1 He contextualizes its energy use by noting that its carbon footprint is smaller than that of industries like cruise ships, and argues that Bitcoin mining's unique economics—its need for the absolute cheapest power—incentivizes the use of otherwise wasted or stranded energy sources, such as flared natural gas and curtailed hydroelectric power. He suggests it could even play a role in bootstrapping new renewable energy projects.1

Despite these arguments, Bitcoin faces formidable challenges. Its history of extreme volatility, including multiple drawdowns of 80% or more, makes it unsuitable as a stable unit of account for individuals or nations, as the experiment in El Salvador has demonstrated.1 Furthermore, the very attributes that make Bitcoin attractive to its proponents—its non-state and permissionless nature—make it a direct threat to the power of the nation-state. This sets up an inherent conflict with the "Return of the State" thesis articulated by Michael Every. Finally, critics argue that a future of "hyperbitcoinization" would create its own version of the Cantillon effect on a massive scale, resulting in an extreme concentration of wealth in the hands of its earliest adopters.

The rise of Bitcoin thus represents a fundamental clash between two competing organizing principles for society: the hierarchical, centralized nation-state and the flat, decentralized network. The analyses of Every, Gromen, and Rogoff are fundamentally state-centric; they describe a world where nations and blocs of nations are the primary actors, competing for power and control over monetary systems. Gladstein's vision is the antithesis: a system that empowers the individual against the state, creating a global, non-national network for value that transcends political authority. These two visions are largely incompatible. A world of resurgent, neo-mercantilist states will inevitably be hostile to a parallel financial system it cannot control and will use its sovereign power to tax, regulate, or prohibit it. Conversely, the widespread adoption of a non-state money would fundamentally undermine the ability of these states to fund themselves through inflation and direct their economies. The coming decades will therefore feature not only a competition *between* states, but a more fundamental competition *between* the very idea of the state and the emergent power of the network. The ultimate trajectory of Bitcoin will serve as a barometer for which of these organizing principles is ascendant in the 21st century.

## **Part IV: Synthesis and Strategic Outlook**

The preceding analysis has deconstructed a complex and often contradictory set of arguments about the future of the global order. This final section synthesizes these perspectives, providing a direct comparison of the key thinkers, a clear evidentiary review of their core claims, and a strategic framework for interpreting the unfolding polycrisis.

### **Points of Convergence and Divergence: A Consolidated View**

While the four primary speakers—Luke Gromen, Michael Every, Kenneth Rogoff, and Alex Gladstein—approach the global situation from different professional and intellectual backgrounds, their analyses converge on several critical points while diverging sharply on the likely outcomes and solutions. The following table provides a consolidated summary of their respective positions.

| Thematic Question | Luke Gromen | Michael Every | Kenneth Rogoff | Alex Gladstein |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Problem** | The terminal phase of a debt-based monetary system colliding with physical (energy) limits. 1 | The failure of the neoliberal economic model, leading to a "Leninist" phase of geopolitical conflict and a battle over new "isms." 1 | Unsustainable sovereign debt levels in the West combined with political dysfunction and a loss of dynamism. 1 | An exploitative system of "monetary colonialism" that drains resources from the Global South and violates human rights. 1 |
| **Future of U.S. Dollar** | Inevitable decline and replacement by a new system where energy is priced in gold. 1 | Remains dominant, but transforms into the anchor of a U.S.-led mercantilist bloc, backed by industrial and military power. 1 | A slow, long-term erosion of its "exorbitant privilege" as the world becomes more multipolar. 1 | Decline due to fiscal irresponsibility and weaponization; challenged by a superior, neutral monetary network (Bitcoin). 1 |
| **U.S. Debt Solution** | "Print the interest"; an inevitable inflationary default that destroys the value of the debt. 1 | Print money, but strategically channel it into supply-side re-industrialization and national security priorities. 1 | A period of high inflation to erode the debt's real value, followed by politically painful austerity. 1 | Implicitly, a transition to a sounder, non-state money that enforces fiscal discipline. 1 |
| **China's Trajectory** | A formidable industrial competitor whose rise is challenging the energy-for-Treasuries bargain. 1 | A peer industrial competitor whose export-led model is vulnerable to the new mercantilism. 1 | In a "deep crisis"; facing long-term stagnation due to property collapse, poor demographics, and declining leadership competence. 1 | An authoritarian state whose capital controls and lack of rule of law make it vulnerable to capital flight and unable to offer a true reserve currency. 1 |
| **Role of Gold/Bitcoin** | Gold is the ultimate neutral reserve asset and the likely anchor of the next monetary system. 1 | Gold is a tool for states to hedge against the dollar, but the new system will be based on productive power, not a metal. 1 | Gold is a rational diversification asset for central banks wary of U.S. sanctions. 1 | Bitcoin is a technologically superior form of money that offers a path to individual sovereignty and a just global financial system. 1 |

### **Fact-Checking the Core Claims: An Evidentiary Review**

A rigorous analysis requires grounding these strategic arguments in verifiable facts. The following is a review of the central empirical claims made by the speakers, cross-referenced with supporting data and research.

* **Claim 1 (Gromen):** U.S. mandatory spending plus net interest on the debt consumes 100% or more of federal tax revenue.  
  * **Verdict: Confirmed.** Data from the CBO for fiscal year 2023 shows these two categories accounted for 100.4% of total federal revenues. Projections show this ratio worsening in the coming years due to rising interest costs.1  
* **Claim 2 (Gladstein):** The petrodollar system originated from a specific political agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia in 1973-74 following the Nixon Shock.  
  * **Verdict: Confirmed.** Historical records from the U.S. State Department and contemporary reporting confirm the timeline and terms of the agreement, which established the U.S. dollar as the exclusive currency for oil trade in exchange for U.S. security guarantees.1  
* **Claim 3 (Gladstein):** There has been a net resource drain from the Global South to the Global North since the 1980s.  
  * **Verdict: Supported by academic research.** While the exact valuation is complex and debated, peer-reviewed studies by economists such as Jason Hickel have quantified a significant net appropriation of embodied labor and raw materials from the South by the North, primarily through the mechanism of "unequal exchange".1  
* **Claim 4 (Rogoff):** Financial crises inflict large and often permanent losses on a country's potential GDP.  
  * **Verdict: Supported by a large body of economic research.** While the magnitude of the loss varies, numerous studies by the IMF, NBER, and independent economists conclude that severe financial crises, unlike normal recessions, permanently lower a country's long-term growth trajectory. Japan's "Lost Decades" represent an extreme case, while the 2008 crisis is estimated to have permanently lowered U.S. potential GDP by a range of 2% to 7%.1  
* **Claim 5 (Every):** David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, a cornerstone of free trade advocacy, was based on the assumption of immobile capital.  
  * **Verdict: Confirmed.** Ricardo's original 1817 formulation explicitly assumed that capital and labor did not move between countries. The modern reality of hyper-mobile international capital is a critical departure from the theory's foundational premise, a point long made by heterodox economists.1  
* **Claim 6 (Every):** Economist Joseph Schumpeter, in his later years, recanted his pure free-market stance and argued for a "moral" or "Catholic" economics.  
  * **Verdict: Confirmed.** While known for his theory of "creative destruction," Schumpeter's later speeches and writings reveal a deep concern that capitalism would fail without a moral framework to guide it. He expressed admiration for the corporatist model outlined in the papal encyclical *Quadragesimo Anno*, believing that a system of cooperation and moral responsibility was necessary to prevent the destructive tendencies of pure self-interest.1

### **Navigating the Polycrisis: Recommendations for the Strategic Observer**

This report does not offer investment advice. Instead, it aims to provide a durable mental framework for interpreting the complex and rapidly evolving global landscape. The following are high-level recommendations for the strategic observer seeking to make sense of future events.

* **Watch the Interplay of Finance and Physics.** The central drama of the 21st century is the collision between the infinite growth imperative of the financial system and the finite constraints of the physical world. The most insightful analysis will come from monitoring the relationship between these two realms. Pay less attention to the nominal dollar price of assets and more to the price of key physical commodities—oil, copper, food, and energy in general—relative to the supply of money and credit. This ratio is the truest measure of real-world inflation and systemic stress. When the price of physical goods rises persistently against financial assets, it signals that the "financial overhang" is being reconciled.  
* **Monitor Domestic Politics for Geopolitical Clues.** In the emerging era, foreign policy begins at home. The internal political battles within nations over wealth inequality, industrial strategy, and fiscal priorities are no longer merely domestic affairs; they are the most reliable leading indicators of future geopolitical alignments and conflicts. A turn toward Hamiltonian industrial policy in the United States, for example, is not just an economic choice but a direct signal of a more confrontational strategic posture toward China. The outcome of debates on entitlement reform or military spending will reveal more about a nation's future global role than any diplomatic communique.  
* **Identify the Prevailing "Ism."** Economic language is a powerful indicator of strategic intent. Learn to distinguish between the vocabularies of competing economic paradigms or "isms." When policymakers emphasize "efficiency," "global markets," and "consumer benefits," they are operating within the old neoliberal framework. When their language shifts to "national security," "supply chain resilience," "strategic competition," and creating a "level playing field," they are signaling a move to a new neo-mercantilist paradigm. The dominant "ism" will dictate policy, determine which industries are favored, and shape the strategic environment for years to come.  
* **Follow the Neutral Assets.** In a world of weaponized fiat currencies and escalating geopolitical risk, the actions of central banks and large capital pools speak louder than the words of politicians. Monitor the flow of capital into neutral, non-state, or politically insulated assets. The rate of central bank gold accumulation and the adoption trends of decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin serve as a direct barometer of global distrust in the existing dollar-based system. These flows are not a speculative sideshow; they are a real-time measure of the tectonic shift toward a new, multipolar monetary order.
